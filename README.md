# awesomewm
## a minimal awesome wm config.

I still recommend against doing this.

### Install:
```
sudo apt install awesome awesome-extra
```
```
mkdir ~/.config/awesome; cd ~/.config/awesome
```
```
git clone https://github.com/thefirstminute/awesomewm/
```
```
mv -i awesomewm/* .
```
```
sudo rm -r awesomewm
```
```
chmod 755 scripts/*
```
